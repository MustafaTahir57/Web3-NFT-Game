Welcome to the NFT Card Game repository! This project is an immersive and visually stunning card game built on the Avalanche blockchain, incorporating the power of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Using React.js for the frontend, players can dive into a captivating world where they collect unique NFT cards, engage in battles, and compete against other players.

The game offers a seamless user experience with multiple pages and intuitive navigation. The frontend, built with React.js, provides a responsive and interactive interface, ensuring a smooth and engaging gameplay experience. Players can easily explore their card collection, create battles, and join existing battles with just a few clicks.

To enhance the overall gaming experience, the NFT Card Game incorporates sound effects and animation effects. Sound effects breathe life into the game, immersing players in the action and adding excitement to every move. Animation effects bring the NFT cards to life, showcasing their unique attributes, powers, and abilities, making each battle visually captivating.

At the core of this project lies the smart contract deployed on the Avalanche blockchain. This smart contract enables various functionalities for players to interact with the game. Key functions include:

Register Player: Players can register themselves in the game, creating a unique profile to track their progress, achievements, and card collection.

Create Battle: Players have the ability to create battles, setting the parameters and rules for the battle they want to initiate. This allows for a customized gameplay experience and encourages strategic thinking.

Join Battle: Once battles are created, other players can join these battles and participate in epic card-based confrontations. The game mechanics ensure fairness and balance, creating an exciting and competitive environment.
